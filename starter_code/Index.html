	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a web developer from Orange County who has just begun his web dev class. Previously I worked in the banking industry
		for a little over two years which was educational but soul crushing. I finally pulled the trigger and made the leap to
		go for a new and better career. Before getting into banking, I was working in the golf industry for roughly 6 years. I
		first began that path by working as a golf technician doing club repairs, fittings, and sales then I moved on to work at
		a golf course - Pelican Hill - to work towards getting my teaching credentials for golf but injuries unfortunatly stopped
		me from going in that path and here I am now today working towards a life of coding.</p>
	<h3>Experience</h3>
